      "b'finding the courage to face life full-on is a difficult task . \\nsummoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job . \\nif you\\'re a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you . \\nmelvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be . \\na solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible . \\nhis obsessive-compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk . \\n ( there\\'s a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _very_small_ mosaic tiles . ) \\nmelvin has some great lines . \\nwhen his publisher\\'s receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds \" i think of men and i take away reason and accountability . \" \\ndon\\'t get him wrong , he\\'s not merely a misogynist . \\nsetting his sights higher than that , he\\'s also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors . \\nwhen we first meet him , he\\'s busy dumping a neighbor\\'s dog down the garbage chute . \\nhe\\'s an equal opportunity bigot . \\nhe does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe . \\nmelvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him . \\nand she\\'s none too happy about it . \\nwhen carol doesn\\'t show up for work , melvin\\'s routine is shot and he\\'s determined to do something about it . \\ntracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast . \\nthe fact that she\\'s a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn\\'t appear to phase him , he wants his food . \\nmuch more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery . \\nthis doesn\\'t upset melvin much ( \" don\\'t worry , you\\'ll be back on your knees in no time \" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon\\'s dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey . \\nmelvin is sequestered because he\\'s afraid of what\\'s out there on the other side of his apartment door . \\nhe has to make sure it\\'s ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side . \\nwhen he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes . \\nthis little crack in his emotional armor opens him up . \\nhiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son . \\nhe even develops a friendship with simon . \\nall three people are heavily damaged . \\nmelvin has retreated from life in his apartment . \\ncarol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him . \\nsimon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out . \\na more unlikely trio to form relationships , you\\'d rarely see . \\nand in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments . \\nmelvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice . \\n \" you make me want to be a better man , \" he tells her . \\none of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon . \\ncarol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him . \\nit only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t-shirt contest . \\nthere\\'s hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson . \\ni don\\'t remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over-the-edge melvin is no disappointment . \\nnicholson may be the best actor working today . \\nhunt does a commendable job matching nicholson\\'s energy . \\nshe isn\\'t afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run-down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top-notch . \\ntheir on-screen chemistry is a bit odd . \\neach does a wonderful job with the character , but together , there\\'s something a little off . \\nit\\'s a minor problem : they do work well together , but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four-star film . \\ndirector james l . brooks ( \" terms of endearment \" , \" broadcast news \" ) has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful ( nominees for all the top golden globes , winners from the national board of review , inevitable oscars ) and has a winner on his hands . \\n \" as good as it gets \" isn\\'t exactly the quality that the title says , but it\\'s pretty darn close . \\n ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and as soon as he finishes this one , he\\'s off to an annual 12 night celebration typically held in freezing weather during a snowstorm . \\nthis year it\\'s in the sixties and raining . \\nthat wacky el nino . ) \\n'\n",
